websocket is a minimal and idiomatic WebSocket library for Go.

## Install

```bash
go get nhooyr.io/websocket
```

## Features

- Minimal and idiomatic API
- Tiny codebase at 2200 lines
- First class [context.Context](https://blog.golang.org/context) support
- Thorough tests, fully passes the [autobahn-testsuite](https://github.com/crossbario/autobahn-testsuite)
- [Zero dependencies](https://godoc.org/nhooyr.io/websocket?imports)
- JSON and ProtoBuf helpers in the [wsjson](https://godoc.org/nhooyr.io/websocket/wsjson) and [wspb](https://godoc.org/nhooyr.io/websocket/wspb) subpackages
- Highly optimized by default
- Concurrent writes out of the box
- [Complete Wasm](https://godoc.org/nhooyr.io/websocket#hdr-Wasm) support

## Roadmap

- [ ] WebSockets over HTTP/2 [#4](https://github.com/nhooyr/websocket/issues/4)

## Examples

For a production quality example that shows off the full API, see the [echo example on the godoc](https://godoc.org/nhooyr.io/websocket#example-package--Echo). On github, the example is at [example_echo_test.go](./example_echo_test.go).

Use the [errors.As](https://golang.org/pkg/errors/#As) function [new in Go 1.13](https://golang.org/doc/go1.13#error_wrapping) to check for [websocket.CloseError](https://godoc.org/nhooyr.io/websocket#CloseError). See the [CloseError godoc example](https://godoc.org/nhooyr.io/websocket#example-CloseError).

### Server

```go
http.HandlerFunc(func (w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
	c, err := websocket.Accept(w, r, nil)
	if err != nil {
		// ...
	}
	defer c.Close(websocket.StatusInternalError, "the sky is falling")

	ctx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(r.Context(), time.Second*10)
	defer cancel()

	var v interface{}
	err = wsjson.Read(ctx, c, &v)
	if err != nil {
		// ...
	}

	log.Printf("received: %v", v)

	c.Close(websocket.StatusNormalClosure, "")
})
```

### Client

The client side of this library requires at least Go 1.12 as it uses a [new feature
in net/http](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/26937#issuecomment-415855861) to perform WebSocket handshakes.

```go
ctx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(context.Background(), time.Minute)
defer cancel()

c, _, err := websocket.Dial(ctx, "ws://localhost:8080", nil)
if err != nil {
	// ...
}
defer c.Close(websocket.StatusInternalError, "the sky is falling")

err = wsjson.Write(ctx, c, "hi")
if err != nil {
	// ...
}

c.Close(websocket.StatusNormalClosure, "")
```

## Design justifications

- A minimal API is easier to maintain due to less docs, tests and bugs
- A minimal API is also easier to use and learn
- Context based cancellation is more ergonomic and robust than setting deadlines
- net.Conn is never exposed as WebSocket over HTTP/2 will not have a net.Conn.
- Using net/http's Client for dialing means we do not have to reinvent dialing hooks
  and configurations like other WebSocket libraries
- We do not support the deflate compression extension because Go's compress/flate library
  is very memory intensive and browsers do not handle WebSocket compression intelligently.

## Comparison

Before the comparison, I want to point out that both gorilla/websocket and gobwas/ws were
extremely useful in implementing the WebSocket protocol correctly so _big thanks_ to the
authors of both. In particular, I made sure to go through the issue tracker of gorilla/websocket
to ensure I implemented details correctly and understood how people were using WebSockets in
production.

Another comparison between Go WebSocket libraries is available at [gorilla/websocket](https://github.com/gorilla/websocket#gorilla-websocket-compared-with-other-packages).

### gorilla/websocket

https://github.com/gorilla/websocket

The implementation of gorilla/websocket is 6 years old. As such, it is
widely used and very mature compared to nhooyr.io/websocket.

On the other hand, it has accumulated cruft over the years. There are too many ways to do
the same thing. Just compare the godoc of
[nhooyr/websocket](https://godoc.org/nhooyr.io/websocket) with
[gorilla/websocket](https://godoc.org/github.com/gorilla/websocket) side by side.

The API for nhooyr.io/websocket has been designed such that there is only one way to do things.
This makes it easy to use correctly. Not only is the API simpler, the implementation is
only 2200 lines whereas gorilla/websocket is at 3500 lines. That's more code to maintain,
more code to test, more code to document and more surface area for bugs.

Moreover, nhooyr.io/websocket supports newer Go idioms such as context.Context.
It also uses net/http's Client and ResponseWriter directly for WebSocket handshakes.
gorilla/websocket writes its handshakes to the underlying net.Conn.
Thus it has to reinvent hooks for TLS and proxies and prevents support of HTTP/2.

Some more advantages of nhooyr.io/websocket are that it supports concurrent writes and
makes it very easy to close the connection with a status code and reason.

The ping API is also nicer. gorilla/websocket requires registering a pong handler on the Conn
which results in awkward control flow. With nhooyr.io/websocket you use the Ping method on the Conn
that sends a ping and also waits for the pong.

Additionally, nhooyr.io/websocket can compile to [Wasm](https://godoc.org/nhooyr.io/websocket#hdr-Wasm) for the browser.

In terms of performance, the differences mostly depend on your application code. nhooyr.io/websocket
reuses message buffers out of the box if you use the wsjson and wspb subpackages.
As mentioned above, nhooyr.io/websocket also supports concurrent writers.

The only performance con to nhooyr.io/websocket is that it uses one extra goroutine to support
cancellation with context.Context. This costs 2 KB of memory which is cheap compared to
the benefits.

### x/net/websocket

https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/net/websocket

Unmaintained and the API does not reflect WebSocket semantics. Should never be used.

See https://github.com/golang/go/issues/18152

### gobwas/ws

https://github.com/gobwas/ws

This library has an extremely flexible API but that comes at the cost of usability
and clarity.

This library is fantastic in terms of performance. The author put in significant
effort to ensure its speed and I have applied as many of its optimizations as
I could into nhooyr.io/websocket. Definitely check out his fantastic [blog post](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/million-websockets-and-go-cc58418460bb)
about performant WebSocket servers.

If you want a library that gives you absolute control over everything, this is the library.
But for 99.9% of use cases, nhooyr.io/websocket will fit better. It's nearly as performant
but much easier to use.
